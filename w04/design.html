<h2>Typography and Fonts</h2>
<p>Selecting an appealing color scheme requires an understanding of the color wheel and color theory. With the color wheel, you can explore how different colors relate to each other, including how different combinations and gradients make other colors stand out and the types of feelings and emotions different colors elicit.
    Whether you prefer working with bold colors, vibrant colors‚Äîsuch as bright blue or bright yellow‚Äîor softer colors, finding the right color scheme for your website is an important part of the design.
    Seeing different colors can elicit different emotional reactions in people. Certain colors might elicit feelings of joy or urgency, for example. Therefore, businesses use color schemes to help them set the mood for their website and create stronger brand messaging.</p>
    <p>For the fonts I chose a typography that is clear and simple while making an impact. Having this in mind the colors for titles vary from white and dark blue, while the paragraphs remain in black or white. The colors of the website are brightfull bt elegant, I chose this because our audience varies from 30-65 yeas old. Finally, for the logo I made a clear bold text with minimal details</p><br>
