            <h2>Description</h2>
           <p>Why is chamber of commerce important?
            A chamber of commerce is an integrated business network that works toward the common interests of small businesses in local areas
            across the United States. 
            Your local chamber of commerce can offer visibility, credibility, support, and more for your new or growing business. Having any kind of community online was my priority, my web page will have many different uses that 
            can vary from learning, teaching, connecting, helping someone out.
