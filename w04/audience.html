            <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            <p>This section requires some research about the website visitors by looking into the purpose and the industry, visiting similar sites, and preforming surveys to discover what scenarios are relevant to the visitor. Develop two personasLinks to an external site. to describe the target audience for the project. This section describes the target audience being judicious about the selection of the most plausible demographics.
                Some visitor demographic information to consider is age, income, education, experience with the topic and family status. Additional audience information would include where, when and how the visitor will be accessing the site. What device will they be using?  
                After learning this I realize I needed to recognize the audience, and I did. Teacher from all ages, but especially between 30 and 65</p>
                We are hoping to reach people that teach in english, spanish and french.
